 What is Pan-Africanism?
*************************

Pan-Africanism is a movement that emerged within the diaspora, an organizing political tool that was designed to bring people of African descent together to fight for their rights, whether under colonialism in Africa and the Caribbean or under discrimination in the United States, Brazil or other countries, and to promote the unification of black people, especially those living on the continent of Africa.
