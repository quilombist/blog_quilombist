Lyrics [#]_
***********

| We can smile, nothing else prevent us
| You cannot run away from this skin thing
|
| Thing that we feel, untying knots
| We now know, not all good stuff is from abroad
|
| It's our song in the streets and bars
| Brings us to reason, remembering Palmares
|
| It was good to insist, composing and listening
| Who can resist the force of our Pagodes
|
| And if the Samba does, sleepy prisoner of our tom-toms
| And a Banjo frees people from their emotions
|
| Exciting even more the head of a composer
| Eternal stronghold of peace, the spring of many types of love
|
| [Chorus 2x]
| Popular art born from our ground
| It is our people who produce the concert and sign as directors
|
